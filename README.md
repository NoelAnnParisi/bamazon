# bamazon

Using Node.js and a MySQL database I've built a backend application which allows users to browse "Bamazon". 

## The views: 
Customer 
 * view the inventory 
 * "Buy" the items (so long as their order does not exceed the quantity in stock). 
Manager
 * View products for sale
 * View low inventory
 * Add to inventory
 * Add new product

These views allow user's to interact with the MySQL database in order to perfom the selected action. 

### Built with:
* Node.js
* MySQL
* Javascript 

### Libraries used:
* Prompt
* Inquirer
* mysql
* console.table
* color
